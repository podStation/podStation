# 2020-02-14 Advertisement in podStation

Hello podStation user!

If you are reading this, you probably saw an ad in podStation.

I have refrained from adding ads in podStation already for a long time.  
It is actually something I did not pursue myself, but I was contacted by Toucan, and, after some consideration, decided to give it a try.

Toucan is a product that aims to help people to learn a new language by replacing words in pages you visit.  
I have tried it and checked its [Privacy Policy](https://jointoucan.com/privacy), and considered it was a suitable product to offer to podStation users.

**One important note**, you can permanently dismiss the banner, and continue to use podStation without ads as you always did. 

## About your privacy

The ad you will see in podStation is packaged with the app, it is not loaded from any third party website.

You are not exposed to Toucan until you click in the ad and navigate to their website.

## Any feedback?

If you have any feedback about this, I'll be happy to hear.

You can find our means of contact [here](https://github.com/podStation/podStation#support-and-contact).
